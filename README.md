📝 Project Description
This project focuses on simulating a Quantum Galton Board and Quantum Walk using the Qiskit framework to generate various probability distributions. The core objective is to develop and optimize quantum circuits to maximize their accuracy and layer count when executed on a noisy simulator. A key aspect of the work involved analyzing the project's requirements, confirming that the majority of the code's objectives were met, and identifying areas for potential improvement.
